In Greek mythology, Spartans are said to have used Scytales as tools to deliver encrypted messages during military campaigns.

Scytales were cylindrical structure with letters engraved on strip of parchment wound around it and used 'transposition cipher' mechanism. 

Scytale helps encrypt the selected files using some user-given-key and transmitt them to amazon servers usign AWS.

You can download the files but can't unlock them, if you don't have the key.

God Bless!
