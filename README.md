In Greek mythology, Spartans are believed to have used Scytales as tools for encrypting and securely transmitting messages during military campaigns.

A Scytale consisted of a cylindrical structure with a strip of parchment wound around it. Messages were inscribed on the parchment, and the "transposition cipher" mechanism was used to rearrange the letters for encryption. Only those with an identical Scytale could decode the message.

Inspired by this ancient encryption technique, Scytale is a tool that encrypts selected files using a user-provided key and securely transmits them to Amazon servers via AWS.

Files can be downloaded, but without the correct key, they remain locked and inaccessible.
